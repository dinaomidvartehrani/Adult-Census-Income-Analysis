## Description

The goal is to predict income levels (<=50K or >50K) based on various factors, including age, education, occupation, marital status, etc. 
The challenges to be overcome include handling missing data, class imbalance, feature engineering, and interpreting the results. 
The expectations are to develop a model, identify influential factors, evaluate model performance, compare different methodologies, and generate actionable insights.

## Dataset
The data is the Adult Census Income dataset from Kaggle. It contains approximately 48,842 instances, each with 15 features and a target variable indicating income level. 
The features cover a broad spectrum of demographic and work-related information.


## Models
The proposed methodology includes data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalizing numerical features), exploratory data analysis, 
model selection, model evaluation, cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning, and analysis of results.
The goal is not just to develop an effective model but also to understand the variables influencing income levels and provide insights for policy-making.
